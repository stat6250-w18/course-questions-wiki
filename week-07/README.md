- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Can the length of a variable be altered and reassigned after being referenced first in a DATA step?
- *Answer* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): No, LENGTH statement will not change the size of a variable if it was created before in another statement. Hence best practice is to make sure that the LENGTH statement appears before any reference to the variable in DATA step.
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): How to determine the length of a new variable?
- *Answer* (cnguyen77-stat6250): The length of a variable is determined by its first reference in the DATA step. When creating a new character variable, SAS allocates as many bytes of storage space as there are characters in the reference to that variable. The first reference to a new variable can also be made with a LENGTH statement or an assignment statement.
- *Question* (ldai4-stat6250): What can the length of a new variable be determined by?
- *Answer* (ldai4-stat6250):  The length of a variable is determined by its first reference in the DATA step. When creating a new character variable, SAS allocates as many bytes of storage space as there are characters in the reference to that variable.
- *Question* (xyin6-stat6250): Is the order of If-statements matter in terms of defining variable length?
- *Answer* (xyin6-stat6250): Yes, SAS allocates as many bytes of storage space as there are characters in the first value that it encounters of the variable. So the length of following variables are restricted by first variable length.

- Answer (lceballos-stat6250): Yes, you can use them in a PROC SQL step (e.g select Name, case when).
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): How the assignment statements assign a missing value ?
- Answer(nshrivastava2-stat6250): If the expression produces a missing value, the sum statement ignores it. However, that assignment statements assign a missing value if the expression produces a missing value.
- *Question* (cli19-stat6250): How does writing separate IF statements differ from IF-ELSE statements for mutually exclusive conditions?
- *Answer* (cli19-stat6250): Utilizing IF-ELSE statements for mutually exclusive conditions can save computation time compared to separate IF statements. Rather than stepping through each IF statement is true or not, IF-ELSE tells SAS to stop and move to the next observation once it encounters a true statement.
- Question (tbishaw-stat6250): When do you want to use an IF-THEN statment with a DELETE statement in SAS? 
- Question (tchan49-stat6250):Would ELSE statement execute if the previous IF-THEN/ELSE is true? 
- Answer (tchan49-stat6250):ELSE statement excutes only if the previous IF-THEN/ELSE is false.

- *Question* (who7-stat6250): Would we use While loop in SAS?
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Why do b, c, and d fail to emulate the desired code?
- *Answer* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Option b rewrites type='Fixed' to type='Unknown', because code="1" isn't excluded.  Option C renames all code ^= 1 to '2' and type to 'variable'; the second else command is also invalidated.  In option D, when Code=1 and Type=Fixed then they are rewritten as Code=2 and Type=Variable, else type='Unknown'.
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): Are there any limits in term of using ELSE statement to specify a series of mutually exclusive conditions?
- Question (ljiang11−stat6250): What would happen when code is neither 1 or 2?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): What is the best coding practice to evaluate mutually exclusive conditions?
- *Answer* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Using ELSE statements is a good practice for conditional processing and IF-THEN/ELSE should be constructed with conditions of decreasing probability.We can also use SELECT groups in DATA steps for mutually exclusive conditions and it is more efficient that multiple IF-THEN-ELSE statements.
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): What is the function of ELSE statement?
- *Answer* (cnguyen77-stat6250): You can write multiple ELSE statements to specify a series of mutually exclusive conditions. The ELSE statement must immediately follow the IF-THEN statement in your program. An ELSE statement executes only if the previous IF-THEN/ELSE statement is false.
- *Question* (ldai4-stat6250): Must the ELSE statement immediately follow the IF-THEN statement?
- *Question* (xyin6-stat6250): When we assign values to a variable, should we use quotation marks for both numeric value and character value?
- Question (lsun20-stat6250): How the ELSE statement works?
- Answer (lsun20-stat6250): The ELSE statement works when the previous IF-THEN/ELSE statement is false.
- *Question*(kamirneni-stat6250): Does WHEN statement identify both TRUE and FALSE statements?
- *Question* (sbagdi-stat6250): Why can a numeric value stand alone in a condition?



[Course Textbook Chapter 10, Problem 9]
- *Question* (aamiri2-stat6250): What is the main purpose of using a LENGTH statement? What is the general form of it?
- *Answer* (aamiri2-stat6250): LENGTH statement is used to specify the number of bytes for TestLength before the first value is referenced in the DATA step. The general form is usually LENGTH variable(s) <$> length. The variable is the name to be assigned a length, $ is used if it is a character variable, and length is an integer that specifies the length.

- Answer (lceballos-stat6250): Before the variable is ever mentioned in the data step.
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): What if you want to initialize sum varible to a different number, other than zero?
- Answer(nshrivastava2-stat6250): The RETAIN statement is used to assigns an initial value to a retained variable and prevents variables from being initialized each time the DATA step executes.
- *Question* (cli19-stat6250): Does the order of the length statement in a DATA step have any affect on the output data set?
- Question (tbishaw-stat6250): What is the key difference between the DROP and KEEP statments? 
- Answer (tbishaw-stat6250): The KEEP and DROP statments are similar, except that the KEEP statement specifies a list of variables to write to output data sets.
- Question (tchan49-stat6250):Where shoud LENGTH statement be placed in DATA step? Before or all the reference to variables in DATA step?

- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Is the length of a variable fixed or does it change with each reference ?
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): Where should the LENGTH statement be placed in DATA step?
- *Answer* (cnguyen77-stat6250): Make sure the LENGTH statement appears before any other reference to the variable in the DATA step. If the variable has been created by another statement, then a later use of the LENGTH statement will not change its length.
- *Question* (ldai4-stat6250): Who can determine the length of a new variable?
- *Answer* (ldai4-stat6250):  The length of a new variable is determined by the first reference in the DATA step, not by data value.
- *Question* (xyin6-stat6250): Where should we put the LENGTH statement to specify a length?
- *Answer* (xyin6-stat6250): It should appear before any other reference to the variable in teh DATA step, otherwise of the variable has been created by another statement, the LENGTH statement will not work.
- Question (lsun20-stat6250): Why the length of the variable Type is not 10 with the Length statement?
- Answer (lsun20-stat6250): Because the LENGTH statement is in the wrong place, it should before any other reference to the variable in the DATA step.
- *Question*(kamirneni-stat6250): When does SAS issue an error in the SELECT-WHEN statement?

- Question (tchan49-stat6250):Can KEEP or DROP statement be written in PORC statement? 
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): In common SAS usage, is it preferred to use DROP statements within DATA steps to explicitly exclude certain variables, or to use KEEP to select specific variables to include?
- *Answer* (jbettonville-stat6250): It is preferred to use KEEP statements to explicitly include specific variables, as this makes the code somewhat "self-documenting" by showing what is included rather than what is excluded, and it also prevents unwanted columns from being included in case the input data changes. (n.b. Week 5 SAS recipes lines 89-93)

- Question (lceballos-stat6250): Does the drop statement delete original data or does it just exclude it from the new dataset?
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Where to specify DROP= and KEEP= options ?
- Answer(nshrivastava2-stat6250): One can specify DROP= and KEEP= in either the DATA statement or the SET statement, depending on whether or not one want to process values of the variables in that DATA step. If one don't process certain variables and don't want them to appear in the new data set, then specify them in the DROP= option in the SET statement. And,  If one do need to process a variable in the original data set (in a subsetting IF statemente), one must specify the variable in the DROP= option in the DATA statement. Otherwise, the statement that is using the variable for processing causes an error.
- *Question* (cli19-stat6250): What is the purpose of specifying DROP or KEEP variables in the SET statement?
- Question (tbishaw-stat6250): What are the steps you need to perform before you create the data set? 
- Answer (tbishaw-stat6250): To create the data set, you must first reference the library in which your data is stored and then you wirte a DATA step to read your data and create a new data set; you must assign a libref to the SAS library that will store the data set.
- Question (tchan49-stat6250):What is the difference between having DROP/KEEP option in SET statement or DATA step? 
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): What is the difference between using DROP as an option on a DATA step and using DROP or KEEP as an option in a SET statement within a DATA step?
- *Answer* (jbettonville-stat6250): Using DROP or KEEP in the SET statement specifies what columns from the source data set are dropped or kept, at which point additional conditions may be applied to remove specific observations (i.e. an IF statement can be used following the SET statement to choose only rows that meet a specific condition). Using DROP as an option in the DATA step can be used to exclude columns that were included in the SET statement that may have been used when selecting which observations to select, but that are not desired in the final output data set.

- *Answer* (who7-stat6250): Sometimes it is present a more clear cut dataset taht shows only varaibles that is needed.
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): What is wrong with option B?
- *Answer* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Not only is ordrtime never read, thus invalidating the if statement, but also we are creating the orders dataset rather than reading it.
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): For this problem, the variables Age, Weight, and Group are specified using the KEEP= option in the SET statement. And after processing, Age and Group are dropped in the DATA statement. The question is what happens if we are going to change (KEEP=product units price ordrtime) to (DROP=product units price ordrtime) in the SET statement?
- Question (ljiang11−stat6250): What are the variables left?
- Answer (ljiang11−stat6250): product, units, price.
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250):Is it necessary to carry over all the variables that are being evaluated to output dataset? Can the variables being evaluated be dropped from output dataset?
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): What is the function of DROP= data set option?
- *Answer* (cnguyen77-stat6250): The DROP= data set option prevents variables from being written to the data set.
- *Question* (ldai4-stat6250): If we need to reference a variable in the original data set, do we need to specify the variable in the DROP= option in the DATA statement?
- *Answer* (ldai4-stat6250): Yes, we should specify the variable in the DROP= or KEEP= option in the DATA statement. Otherwise, the statement that references the variable uses a missing value for the variable.

- *Question* (asharda-stat6250): What is a defensive programming practice?
- *Question* (aacharya4−stat6250): What is the purpose of using IN data set option in SAS?
- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): The IN data set option names the indicator variable that determines whether the input data set is part of the current observation. The value of the indicator variable is 1, if input data set contributes to current  observation. Otherwise, the value of indicator variable is 0.
- Question (lceballos-stat6250): What does the IN statement used for in this recipe?
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): How END and DO statement works?
- Answer(nshrivastava2-stat6250): The DO statement specifies that the statements following the DO statement be executed as a group until a matching END statement appears. DO statements often appear in IF-THEN/ELSE statements, where they designate groups of statements to be performed when the IF condition is true or false.
- *Question* (cli19-stat6250): Should length be defined outside the do loop rather than inside?
- Question (tbishaw-stat6250): How is the LEGNGTH statement used in SAS? 
- Answer (tbishaw-stat6250): The LENGTH statemnt is used in the dATA step to specify a variable's length. If the varaible is character, the length applies to the PDV and the output data set. If the variable is numeric, the length applies only to the output data set.   
- Question (tchan49-stat6250): What is the benefit having in= dataset option? 
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): Is it possible to resolve warnings about multiple lengths being specified for the same variable when multiple data sets are joined vertically?
- *Answer* (jbettonville-stat6250): The warnings about multiple lengths occur because the length of the initial observation for the affected variables in one data set are not the same length as they are in the second. In the example, the Academic_Year variable has length 19 in the first input data set and 60 in the second. It is possible to resolve this issue by specifying the length of this variable within the DATA step prior to the SET statement in which the input data sets are referenced, and choosing a value that is at least as long as the longest instance of this variable; by using the statement "length Academic_Year $ 60;", the warning for the Academic_Year variable will not be shown because the length has been declared to be equal to the longest version of this variable among the input data sets. However, while this resolves the warning for one variable, it may not be a scalable solution as it would require the length of all variables to be specified prior to the SET statement.
