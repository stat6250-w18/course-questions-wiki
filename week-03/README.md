In order to prepare your Week 3 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-3" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 3 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

- the master branch of the stat6250/course_questions_wiki repo as the base fork and

- the week-3 branch of your version of the repo as the head fork.

The instructor will then review the pull request and make comments should further revision be needed. Then, after the contents of the pull request have been finalized without any merge conflicts, the instructor will merge the pull request.

- *Answer* (tbishawstat6250): Although there are multiple formats in which you can write SAS statements in, a consistent layout enhances readability and helps you and others understand the programâ€™s purpose.

- *Question* (tbishawstat6250): What actions do the following Text Editor Line Commands execute: Cn, Dn, In, Mn, Rn, A, and B?
- *Answer* (tbishawstat6250): Cn: copies n lines (where n = a number up to 9999), Dn: deletes n lines, In: inserts n blank lines, Mn, moves n lines, Rn: repeats current line n times, A: after (used with C, I, and M), B: before (used with C, I, and M)



[Course Textbook Chapter 3, Problem 6]
- *Question* (tbishawstat6250): What are some of the most common errors in SAS? Where can you review the messages to check for errors each time you submit a SAS program?

- *Question* (tbishawstat6250): What is the functionality of the SORT procedure when creating a report?
- *Answer* (tbishawstat6250): The SORT procedure rearranges the observations in a SAS data set, creates a new SAS data set that contains the rearranged observations, replace the original SAS data set by default, and can sort multiple variables (ascending or descending order).


[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 7]
- *Question* (tbishawstat6250): Which SAS statement do you use to produce column totals for numeric variables? And which SAS statement do you use for generating subtotals? 


[Course Textbook Chapter 4, Problem 9]
- *Question* (tbishawstat6250): What are the steps to generating a SAS LISTING output?
- *Answer* (tbishawstat6250): To generate SAS LISTING output, you must first select Tools and then you go to Options and under Options you select Preferences. In the Preference menu you will find the Results tab and the Creating Listing option.

- *Question* (tbishawstat6250): What is the procedure to sorting a report based on values of a variable and which SAS statement do we use to perform this action?
- *Answer* (tbishawstat6250): To sort a report based on values of a variable, we would use the PROC SORT statement to sort the data before using the PRINT procedure to create reports from the data. 



[recipe_for_printing_values Week 3 Recipe]
- *Question* (tbishawstat6250): What does the PROC PRINT statement display by default? And what are the observations displayed?
