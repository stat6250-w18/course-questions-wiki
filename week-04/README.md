- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Why we use Value Statement in PROC FORMAT step?  
- Answer (nshrivastava2-stat6250): You use a VALUE statement in a PROC FORMAT step to specify the way that you want the data values to appear in your output. You define value-range sets to specify the values to be formatted and the formatted values to display instead of the stored value or values. The value portion of a value-range set can include an indiv idual value, a range of values, a list of values, or a keyword. The keyword OTHER is used to define a value to display if the stored data value does not match any of the defined value-ranges.

[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 1]
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What does PROC means do in its simplest form?
- Question(pcheng14-stat6250): When should we use the MEANS procedure in SAS?
- Answer(pcheng14-stat6250): When we solve the mathematic problems, we can use it.
- *Question* (cli19-stat6250): How does PROC MEANS deal with missing values?
- *Answer* (cli19-stat6250): Missing values are not included in the calculation (unless specified with "missing"), and sample size is (N) will show the total number of non-missing rows.
- *Question* (aacharya4-stat6250): Why is the purpose of using MAXDEC option in PROC MEANS statement?
- *Answer* (aacharya4-stat6250): By default, PROC MEANS statement displays the entire width of numeric variable. MAXDEC option in PROC MEANS statement is used to limit it to specified number of decimal places. 
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): How could we create a procedure that invokes specific keywords used in the MEANS statement? I.e. Could a user create a single function that outputs only Median, Mode, and Standard Error when called, without needing to specify this collection of keywords more than once?
- *Answer* (jbettonville-stat6250): This could be accomplished with a macro declaration and call, such as:
```%LET mmse = median mode stderr;
proc means data=mydata &mmse.;
run;
```
- Question (who7-stat6250): What is the main difference between PROC MEAN and PROC SUMMARY?
- *Answer* (asharda-stat6250): The difference between the two procedures is that PROC MEANS produces a report by default  (remember that you can use the NOPRINT option to suppress the default report). By contrast, to produce a report in PROC SUMMARY, you must include a PRINT option in the PROC SUMMARY statement.
- Question (tchan49-stat6250): Can you get the median of the data set by the default setting of the MEAN procedure?
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): What are the default statistics produced by the MEANS procedure?
- Answer (ttruong59-stat6250): By default, MEANS procedure returns the n, mean, min, max, and standard deviation.
- Question (ldeng11-stat6250): What are the default output when you use the MEANS procedure.
- Answer (ldeng11-stat6250): mean, minimum, maximum, n-count, standard deviation.
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Why is standard deviation a default statistic instead of variance?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): What are the default statistical measures produced by MEANS procedure?

- Answer (nshrivastava2-stat6250): The FREQ procedure can also be used to validate a data set. A one-way frequency table, which displays all discrete values for a variable and reports on missing values, easily identifies the existence of invalid or missing values. You can use the ORDER=FREQ and NLEVELS options to identify duplicate values. After you've identified invalid values, you can use PROC PRINT to display the corresponding observations.

- *Question* (sbagdi-stat6250): What are the two ways to write column names to display columns in an output table?
- *Answer* (sbagdi-stat6250): For columns to be displayed in separate tables, the column names are to be separated with a space in between. And for a cross tabulation format, an asterisk is used between column names.

- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What is the difference between the discrete quantitative variable and the continuous quantitative variable?
- Question(pcheng14-stat6250): When should we have to temporarily binning values in SAS?
- *Question* (cli19-stat6250): Does the order of the statements within PROC FREQ matter? That is, can the "format" statement precede the "table" statement?
- *Question* (aacharya4-stat6250): How can we permanently associate a format with a variable?
- *Answer* (aacharya4-stat6250): A varible can be permanently associated with a format if the format is defined in the data step.
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): Can implicit ranges with half-closed intervals be written with the inclusive term on the right-hand side, as in (.36-.67] instead of [.36-.67)?
- *Answer* (jbettonville-stat6250): Changing the format of a label in a VALUE statement from .36-<.67 to .36<-.67 does not cause an error to occur when the statement runs, so this construction appears to be syntactically valid.
- Question (who7-stat6250): how can we avoid edge cases when binning values?
- Answer (who7-stat6250): We can use the keywords low or high to avoid edge cases when binning values.
- Question (tchan49-stat6250): How can you permanently associate a format to a variable? 
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): Temporarily binning values with a format is a two-step process, can a user make it permanently?
- Question (ldeng11-stat6250): What is “missing list” statement doing here?
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Can I format formats?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): How to specify non inclusive range of unique values while defining FORMAT?
- Question (lceballos-stat6250): Can you make multiple bins to combine different variables that roll up into different categories?
- Question (aguenane-stat6250): When binning values, where should semi colon(s) be placed? 
- *Question* (aamiri2-stat6250): When are appropriate scenarios when we would need to roll-up/bin values?
- Question(dfei-stat6250): Why there is no space between "norow, nocol and nopercent" after slash? 
- *Question* (kamirneni-stat6250): In discrete quantitative variables, does taking the high and low options affect the outcome of data, resulting in neglecting of edge cases? 
- *Answer* (asharda-stat6250): For the discrete quantitative variable, the low and high options are used to avoid edge cases, and explicit ranges are associated with bin values
- *Question* (ldai4-stat6250): Can we use PROC FORMAT statement to bin numerical variables?
- *Answer* (ldai4-stat6250): Yes, we can use PROC FORMAT to bin a numerical variable into categories.
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250):  How binning works?
- Answer (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Statistical data binning is a way to group a number of more or less continuous values into a smaller number of "bins". For example, if you have data about a group of people, you might want to arrange their ages into a smaller number of age intervals.PROC HPBIN does not allow empty bins. If an empty bin is detected because of an insufficient number of nonmissing observations, PROC HPBIN issues an error and exits.
- Question (lsun20-stat6250): What's the means of the following statement "value Enrollment_K12_bins"?
- *Question* (xyin6-stat6250): How to permanently associate a format with a variable in the DATA step?
- Question (tbishaw-stat6250): How do you supress table information?
- Answer (tbishaw-stat6250): You can supress the display of specific statistics by adding one or more options to the TABLES statement, such as: NOFREQ supresses cell frequencies, NOPRECENT supresses cell percentages, NOROW supresses row percentages, and NOCOL supresses column percentages. 
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): How to group values in a SAS dataset without changing the underlying values in the dataset?
- *Question* (sbagdi-stat6250): What difference does low and high options make for discrete and continuous quantitative variables? 
- *Answer* (sbagdi-stat6250): The low and high options in general are used to avoid the edge cases. In particular, for discrete quant variables, the explicit ranges of variables are associated with bin values and for continuous variables, the ranges of variables is implicit.
