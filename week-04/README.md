[Course Textbook Chapter 7, Problem 6]
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Why we use Value Statement in PROC FORMAT step?  
- Answer (nshrivastava2-stat6250): You use a VALUE statement in a PROC FORMAT step to specify the way that you want the data values to appear in your output. You define value-range sets to specify the values to be formatted and the formatted values to display instead of the stored value or values. The value portion of a value-range set can include an indiv idual value, a range of values, a list of values, or a keyword. The keyword OTHER is used to define a value to display if the stored data value does not match any of the defined value-ranges.

[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 2]
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Which procedures can display the observations that contain invalid or missing values?
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What does PROC means do in its simplest form?
- Question(pcheng14-stat6250): When should we use the MEANS procedure in SAS?
- Answer(pcheng14-stat6250): When we solve the mathematic problems, we can use it.
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): How does PROC MEANS deal with missing values?
- *Answer* (cli19−stat6250): Missing values are not included in the calculation (unless specified with "missing"), and sample size is (N) will show the total number of non-missing rows.
- *Question* (aacharya4−stat6250): Why is the purpose of using MAXDEC option in PROC MEANS statement?
- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): By default, PROC MEANS statement displays the entire width of numeric variable. MAXDEC option in PROC MEANS statement is used to limit it to specified number of decimal places. 
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): How could we create a procedure that invokes specific keywords used in the MEANS statement? I.e. Could a user create a single function that outputs only Median, Mode, and Standard Error when called, without needing to specify this collection of keywords more than once?
- *Answer* (jbettonville-stat6250): This could be accomplished with a macro declaration and call, such as:
```%LET mmse = median mode stderr;

[Course Textbook Chapter 8, Problem 7]
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): How PROC FREQ Validate the dataset?  
- Answer (nshrivastava2-stat6250): The FREQ procedure can also be used to validate a data set. A one-way frequency table, which displays all discrete values for a variable and reports on missing values, easily identifies the existence of invalid or missing values. You can use the ORDER=FREQ and NLEVELS options to identify duplicate values. After you've identified invalid values, you can use PROC PRINT to display the corresponding observations. 
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What can the FREQ procedure be used for?
- Question(pcheng14-stat6250):Besides PROC FREQ, do we have other ways to create a table of frequencies and percentages?
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Does PROC FREQ also count the number and percent of missing values?
- *Answer* (cli19−stat6250): Under the "tables" statement, "missing" needs to be specified in order to include rows with missing values to the summary table. Otherwise, SAS excludes these by default and shows the total number missing at the bottom of the table.
- *Question* (aacharya4−stat6250): How is the purpose of using TABLES statement in PROC FREQ ?
- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): The purpose of using TABLES statement in PROC FREQ is to determine the order in which the variables appear in the PROC FREQ report.
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): Does PROC FREQ have any options that would cause character strings that are equal except for capitalization to be considered identical for purposes of counting? I.e. "Place" counted in the same group as "PLACE"?
- Question (who7−stat6250): Is there other keywords taht you can ues like in PROC MEAN?
- Question (tchan49-stat6250): Do you need to use different statements to summarize numeric and character variables?
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): What is a required statement to create a table of frequencies and percentages for all variables in a dataset?
- Answer (ttruong59-stat6250): The PROC FREQ is the required statement for the FREQ procedure.

- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Is having a frequency table for numeric variables useful?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Why is it advisable to use TABLES statment while creating crosstabulation table?
- *Answer* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): FREQ procedure creates frequency table for all variables in a data set. However, it may not be meaningful for conitnuous numeric values like timestamp. Hence it is better to specify the variables that are categorical explicitly using TABLES statement.
- Question (lceballos-stat6250): Does PROC FREQ work on binomial distributions?

- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): The purpose of using "class" statement in PROC MEANS is to group the PROC MEANS output by the values of variables mentioned in the class statement.
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): How might we use options with PROC MEANS to exclude variables with a number of observations beneath a certain threshold from the output?
- Question (who7−stat6250): Which are the most often uses PROC statement in statistical anlysis?
- Answer (who7−stat6250): PROC MEAN and PROC FREQUENCY are some of the most often use PROC statments.
- Question (tchan49-stat6250): How do you decide when to use PROC MEAN or PROC FREQ?
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): Both PROC MEANS and PROC FREQ are used to tell SAS which variables to summarize, but what are the major differences between of these 2 statements?
- Question (ldeng11−stat6250): What is the “missing” statement doing here? What happen if you don’t include “missing” statement here?
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Can I save a mean as a variable in a dataset?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): Is 'Class' statement mandatory while summarizing data using MEANS procedure?
- Question (lceballos-stat6250): How can we ignore rows with missing values?

- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): What is Cross-tabulation in SAS ?
- Answer (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Cross tabulation involves producing cross tables also called contingent tables using all possible combinations of two or more variables. In SAS it is created using PROC FREQ along with the TABLES option.
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): Why should you use the nlevels options?
- Question(pcheng14-stat6250): Have any better way can we summarize the qualitative data in SAS?
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Is there a limit on how many levels per variable can be cross-tabulated?
- *Question* (aacharya4−stat6250): How to create two way table using TABLES statement in PROC FREQ?
- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): In PROC FREQ, the TABLES statement contains the keyword "tables" followed by the two variable names joined by asterisk(*). The first varible represents the rows while the second variable represents the columns in PROC FREQ output table.
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): How would the LABEL function be used in a FREQ procedure to alter the headers in the resulting output table?
- Question (who7−stat6250): What are the ways to summarize your data set?
- Answer (who7−stat6250): You can create two-way tables or one-way tables or even present your data as a list.
- Question (tchan49-stat6250): Can you generate a PROC FREQ table for only one variable?
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): Does PROC FREQ have an option to calculate or compute the content (values) between two rows in the table? or should a user need to add another procedure to do so?
- Question (ldeng11−stat6250): What is “nlevels” statement doing here?
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): How long has SAS been around for?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): While creating cross tabulated reports, how are rows with missing variables handled?
- Question (lceballos-stat6250): How do we summarize multiple variables at the same time using PROC FREQ?



[recipe_for_temporarily_binning_values Week 4 Recipe]
- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250):  How binning works?
- Answer (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Statistical data binning is a way to group a number of more or less continuous values into a smaller number of "bins". For example, if you have data about a group of people, you might want to arrange their ages into a smaller number of age intervals.PROC HPBIN does not allow empty bins. If an empty bin is detected because of an insufficient number of nonmissing observations, PROC HPBIN issues an error and exits.
- *Question* (shatcher4-stat6250): What is the difference between the discrete quantitative variable and the continuous quantitative variable?
- Question(pcheng14-stat6250): When should we have to temporarily binning values in SAS?
- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Does the order of the statements within PROC FREQ matter? That is, can the "format" statement precede the "table" statement?
- *Question* (aacharya4−stat6250): How can we permanently associate a format with a variable?
- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): A varible can be permanently associated with a format if the format is defined in the data step.
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): Can implicit ranges with half-closed intervals be written with the inclusive term on the right-hand side, as in (.36-.67] instead of [.36-.67)?
- *Answer* (jbettonville-stat6250): Changing the format of a label in a VALUE statement from .36-<.67 to .36<-.67 does not cause an error to occur when the statement runs, so this construction appears to be syntactically valid.
- Question (who7−stat6250): how can we avoid edge cases when binning values?
- Answer (who7−stat6250): We can use the keywords low or high to avoid edge cases when binning values.
- Question (tchan49-stat6250): How can you permanently associate a format to a variable? 
- Question (ttruong59-stat6250): Temporarily binning values with a format is a two-step process, can a user make it permanently?
- Question (ldeng11−stat6250): What is “missing list” statement doing here?
- *Question* (jcanfield3-stat6250): Can I format formats?
- *Question* (akrishnamurthy-stat6250): How to specify non inclusive range of unique values while defining FORMAT?
- Question (lceballos-stat6250): Can you make multiple bins to combine different variables that roll up into different categories?
