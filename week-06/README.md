- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Why isn't it necessary to first sort data prior to concatenating data sets?
- *Answer* (cli19−stat6250): SAS checks sequentially if key indicators match in a MERGE statement to combine rows, so sorting the data prior to a merge is required. For concatenating data sets, sorting isn't necessary since SAS essentially stacks the listed data sets and doesn't need to pair data sets by key indicators.
- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): When using BY to interleave multiple data sets, can we apply the DESCENDING keyword to change the order in which the resulting data set is sorted?
- Question (ldeng11−stat6250): How many onbervations will the end data set have after the interleaving process?

- *Question* (xyin6-stat6250): If the length of attributes in two datasets are different, how does the concatenated dataset select the length?
- *Answer* (xyin6-stat6250): SAS takes the length from the first data set that contains the variable. The same is true for the label, format, and informat attributes.
- Question (who7-stat6250): What happens when columsn from 2 datasets have the same column name but different properties?
- Answer (who7-stat6250): Depends on how you merge the datasets.  If you are just appending them, it would just add the 2nd dataset to the 1st dataset.
- Question (ljiang11−stat6250): Why is there missing values?
- Answer (ljiang11−stat6250): Because there are no common columns, SAS will generate missing values for the new variables merged into the dataset.

- Answer(nshrivastava2-stat6250): When SAS interleaves data sets, observations in each BY group in each data set in the SET statement are read sequentially, in the order in which the data sets and BY variables are listed, until all observations have been processed. The new data set includes all the variables from all the input data sets, and it contains the total number of observations from all input data sets.

- Question (nshrivastava2-stat6250): Explian the match merging processing?
- Answer(nshrivastava2-stat6250): When we submit a DATA step, it is processed in two phases: the compilation phase, in which SAS checks the syntax of the SAS statements and compiles them (translates them into machine code). During this phase, SAS also sets up descriptor information for the output data set and creates the program data vector (PDV), an area of memory where SAS holds one observation at a time.

- *Question* (jbettonville-stat6250): If the Name variables were not the same for each ID variable in these data sets, which value of Name would the resulting data set take for each ID?
- *Answer* (jbettonville-stat6250): If the ID variable for both data sets matched but the Name variable in each data set was different for that ID number, the resulting data set would take on the Name variable of the second data set containing the given ID, because the PDV would take the second Name variable and overwrite the first Name variable before adding the new record to the output data set.
- Question (ldeng11−stat6250): How the match merge process handle the unmatched observations?
- *Answer* (sbagdi-stat6250): To exclude the unmatched observations from the output data set, the IN= data set option is used.
