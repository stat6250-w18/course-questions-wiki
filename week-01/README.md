[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 1]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How common it is to abbreviate the word "repository" as "repo"?
- Answer (lsun20-stat6250): For me, it's not very common to abbreviate the "repository" as "repo". I usually thought "repo" like "report" or "repost", because I didn't use github before. After I search online, I found that the programmer allways make the "repository" as "repo" in daily work.
- Answer (mresendiz3-stat6250): It's more common to abbreviate "repossess" as "repo" instead of "repository." However it's important to note that the frequency of the abbreviation "repo" would have to depend on the scope and nature of the conversation (whether discussing computer science or financial trouble.) "In terms of Git, your project folder, which is having all the files required for your project is known as Repository or in short Repo. Everything that you do with regard to your project stays in the repo. When you make changes and save the files, along with saving the file, you also commit them in Git (via its shell program). Committing changes assure that the changes are preserved with regard to the time and day you committed them."

[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 8]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Why does the instructor give extra credit for catching mistakes he's made? Is it to reassure students that everyone makes mistakes, or help him proofread his course materials, or both?
- Answer (mresendiz3-stat6250): To encourage the complete learning from a task. The continuous addition on living projects that require updating and long-term care is analogous to work found in a work-sample portfolio.
- Question (shatcher4−stat6250): For Project 1 Step 1, why does a SAS dataset need to contain at least 200 rows and 20 columns?
- Answer (ldeng11−stat6250): Both. People make mistakes, that is why ofen time we need the review process. The student can get extra credit by catching mistakes because it could demostrate that the student has read the materials carefully, and understand what are the class materials talking about.
- Answer (lsun20-stat6250): Both. It doesn't matter to make mistake, everyone will makes mistakes, the important things is fix it after you make it.
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): What is the mechanism by which extra credit is applied? (i.e. which achievements does it impact, and may it impact different achievements depending upon the circumstance under which it is awarded)
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): I assume the instructor can provide a precise answer, but it seems to me that extra credit to be given for catching errors or seeking clarification would tie into the Reading for Depth Achievement, since it involves thoroughly reviewing written content. I would also think that contributions to the Course Questions Wiki beyond the Week 10 quiz may also relate to the Building General Knowledge and Team-based Problem Solving achievements; in any case I would like to know more about this for sure.

- *Question* (aacharya4−stat6250): What is the difference between Data Step and Proc Step in SAS?
- *Answer* (aacharya4−stat6250): 
Data Step: A portion of the SAS program that begins with a DATA statement and ends with another DATA statement, RUN statement or PROC statement. Generally, in SAS Data steps are used to manage data like input data, modify data etc.
 
![sascode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35093776/34646199-cfe2294a-f316-11e7-9df0-80a3f1af4709.png)

In this case, everything between the “data Grade” and the first “run” statement constitutes the Data Step. The output of this step is given below:

Proc Step: A portion of the SAS program that begins with a PROC statement and ends with another PROC statement, RUN statement or DATA statement. Generally, in SAS Data steps are used to analyze data like doing descriptive statistics, generate graphs and charts and generate reports etc.
In this case, everything between the “proc print” and the second “run” statement constitutes the Proc Step. The result as seen in the Result Viewer.

[fizz-buzz Week 1 SAS Recipe]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Is the mod function at all related to how clocks work, with hours counting from 1 to 12, and then starting back at 1 again?
- Answer (lceballos-stat6250): The mod mod function is related to how a clock works in that there are only a fixed number of values that it could hold. There are about 8760 hours in a year so a clock works very similar to a mod function; mod(hour,12) would be the function of the clock. The 5000th hour of the year would show as 8 on the clock.
