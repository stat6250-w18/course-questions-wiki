## Week 1 Quiz Questions and Answers

In order to prepare your Week 1 Quiz submission, please edit ***this*** document to provide substantive questions for each Quiz Problem and SAS Recipe listed below, as well as answers to at least three questions raised.

All edits should conform to GitHub Markdown specifications (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and should be committed to a branch named "week-1" in your fork of this repo. Then, after all edits have been made/committed, your Week 1 Quiz should be submitted by initiating a pull request using

[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 1]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How common it is to abbreviate the word "repository" as "repo"?
- Question (jbettonville−stat6250): The question on the quiz mentions five items that must be completed, but the instructions for the initial setup have two separate lists of tasks to complete, the first being "Preparing Week 1 Setup Components" with six items, and the second being "Submitting Week 1 Setup Components" with four items. Would it be more accurate to say that ten components must be completed rather than five? 
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): How many components of the Week 1 Setup Instructions does a student need to complete in order to earn an Initial Setup Achievement?

-Question (aamiri2-stat6250): Will we receive any feedback on our week 1 setup so we know if we are on a good start or not?


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 2]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Is the requirement to complete 8 of 10 forum posts to allow people to "slack off" at the end of the quarter, or is it to accommodate students enrolling in the course late, or both?
- Answer (ilankham−stat6250): Both; however, students are encouraged to complete all assignments as written, even if they have no impact on their course grade.
- Question (jbettonville−stat6250): Based upon past offerings of this course, how frequently do students engage with each other's forum posts?
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): How many scheduled forum posts do students need to complete in order to earn a Reading for Breadth Achievement toward their course grade?
- *Answer* (cnguyen77-stat6250): Students should successfully complete at least 8 of the 10 scheduled forum posts by their assigned due dates.

-Question (aamiri2-stat6250): Since it’s required to complete 8 of the 10 weekly forum posts, if we complete all of them do we get extra credit?
- Answer (aamiri2-stat6250): No, even though it is only required to complete 8 of 10, students are encouraged to complete 10 of 10 weekly forum posts. This is meant for students that may start the course late and allows the flexibility. Not to mention this is a great way of helping your grade in case a student forgets a post or is unable to complete one.


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 3]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Is the requirement to complete 8 of 10 weekly quizzes to allow people to "slack off" at the end of the quarter, or is it to accommodate students enrolling in the course late, or both?
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): Do all quizzes have roughly the same number of questions or will the length vary widely? (i.e. Can we expect to spend roughly the same amount of time on quizzes each week, or will some require signficantly more time than others?)

[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 4]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How will code reviews for projects be conducted? Will they involve comments on code in GitHub, meetings with the instructor, or both?
- Answer (ilankham−stat6250): Both; Code Reviews will involve 1:1 meetings with the instructor held through Google Hangouts, during which project code will discussed and commented.
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): At the moment it appears that instructions about only the first step of the first project are available in Blackboard; when will the information about the next steps in each phase of the projects be made available to students?
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): How many team-based projects are required to complete in this course?

-Question (aamiri2-stat6250): Since we have a few  team projects, will we be given a group of students to work with throughout the quarter?



[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 5]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): How similar to Weekly Quiz problems will final exam problems be? In other words, if I want to best prepare for the final exam throughout the course, should I primarily focus on thoroughly understanding weekly quiz problems?
- Answer (ilankham−stat6250): The best way to prepare for the Final Exam is to work through every assigned Weekly Quiz Problem and to develop an understanding of all concepts involved to the point that the problems can be thoroughly answered without consulting reference materials.

- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): To earn an A in STAT 6250 this quarter, what achievement/achievements does a student should earn?

-Question (aamiri2-stat6250): What percentage of students receive an A with full effort of completing the requirements?


[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 7]

[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 8]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Why does the instructor give extra credit for catching mistakes he's made? Is it to reassure students that everyone makes mistakes, or help him proofread his course materials, or both?
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): What is the mechanism by which extra credit is applied? (i.e. which achievements does it impact, and may it impact different achievements depending upon the circumstance under which it is awarded)
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): I assume the instructor can provide a precise answer, but it seems to me that extra credit to be given for catching errors or seeking clarification would tie into the Reading for Depth Achievement, since it involves thoroughly reviewing written content. I would also think that contributions to the Course Questions Wiki beyond the Week 10 quiz may also relate to the Building General Knowledge and Team-based Problem Solving achievements; in any case I would like to know more about this for sure.
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): In what ways does the instructor give extra credit for students in this course?

-Question (aamiri2-stat6250): Can we receive extra credit for proposing a suggestion on the course flow?



[Course Structure Quiz, Problem 9]
- Question (ilankham−stat6250): Instead of a carrier pigeon, what about an unladen swallow?
- Answer (ilankham−stat6250): An African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): What is the reason for requesting contact via Slack instead of via email or Hangouts?
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): One possible reason is that Slack allows for communication and collaboration to happen quickly among a large group. Email is not necessarily pushed to all devices instantaneously (especially with current limitations on push email through Gmail for iPhones), so messages sent via Slack can be reviewed and responded to with less of a delay, and communications can be centralized for all members of the group.
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): What is the best way to contact the instructor with questions/comments?
- *Answer* (cnguyen77-stat6250): Make a direct messages sent through the course Slack team.

- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): Can you recommend any methods of tracking changes to each platform regularly?
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): Blackboard has the "Announcements" page visible upon login that includes any new documents and pages that have been added. The Slack desktop app shows badges on the icon when new posts are available. The Horizon email system can be set up and checked by a mail client regularly. GitHub appears to track activity for each user, but at this time it is unclear if it will also track new updates to repos that have been forked. Any other suggestions for workflow management are appreciated!
- *Question* (cnguyen77-stat6250): Why should students check their CSUEB-provided Horizon Email Accounts daily?

-Question (aamiri2-stat6250): Will we see course announcement via Slack or Github daily?
