- Answer (ldeng11−stat6250): Both. People make mistakes, that is why ofen time we need the review process. The student can get extra credit by catching mistakes because it could demostrate that the student has read the materials carefully, and understand what are the class materials talking about.
- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): What is the mechanism by which extra credit is applied? (i.e. which achievements does it impact, and may it impact different achievements depending upon the circumstance under which it is awarded)
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): I assume the instructor can provide a precise answer, but it seems to me that extra credit to be given for catching errors or seeking clarification would tie into the Reading for Depth Achievement, since it involves thoroughly reviewing written content. I would also think that contributions to the Course Questions Wiki beyond the Week 10 quiz may also relate to the Building General Knowledge and Team-based Problem Solving achievements; in any case I would like to know more about this for sure.

- Question (jbettonville-stat6250): What is the reason for requesting contact via Slack instead of via email or Hangouts?
- Answer (jbettonville-stat6250): One possible reason is that Slack allows for communication and collaboration to happen quickly among a large group.

- *Question* (cli19−stat6250): Are there other methods of printing notes/messages to the log? Or can put only reside in a data step?
- *Answer* (cli19−stat6250): Yes. Another statement that is useful for debugging code is %put to write text string and what macro variable resolve to.
